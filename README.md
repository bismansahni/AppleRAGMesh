# AppleRAGMesh

**AppleRAGMesh** is an on-device Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for the Apple ecosystem.  
It creates a **local mesh network** between your Apple devices (Mac, iPhone, iPad), allowing one device to **query documents stored on any other nearby device** ‚Äî all without internet access.

---

### üí° What It Does

- Builds a mesh using `MultipeerConnectivity` (Bluetooth / peer-to-peer Wi-Fi).
- Enables one Apple device (e.g. Mac) to **query files stored on other devices** (e.g. iPad, iPhone).
- Automatically handles document chunking, local embedding, and retrieval.
- All processing happens **on-device** ‚Äî no cloud, no server, no internet.

---

### üé• Demo (macOS)

Currently demonstrated on **MacBook**, showcasing:
- Adding PDF/TXT files.
- Generating embeddings locally with MiniLM.
- Querying across the mesh (e.g. asking about a file that's only on another device).
- LLM answering achieved via CoreML optimized version of Mistral7B

### üì± Extending to iPhone & iPad

- The codebase is ready to support iOS and iPadOS.
- Just add a new target for iPhone or iPad in Xcode.
- Once connected, you can **ask your Mac to query files stored only on your iPad/iPhone** ‚Äî no need to touch the other device.

### ‚ö° Why It‚Äôs Useful

Perfect for:
- When you‚Äôve forgotten which device a file is on.
- Quickly referencing a document on another device without opening or browsing.
- Local, fast, secure retrieval in Airplane mode or without Wi-Fi.

**No internet required.**  
**No third-party servers.**  
**Just Apple devices talking directly.**
